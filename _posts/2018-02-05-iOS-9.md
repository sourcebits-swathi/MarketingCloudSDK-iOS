The MarketingCloudSDK framework supports iOS 9 under armv7, armv7s and arm64 architectures.

To support iOS 9, build your app with Xcode 9 or later, and use conditional coding via Apple's `available` attributes when you set up push notification handling and when you register for push notifications during SDK configuration.

### Register for Push Notifications

To register for push notifications on iOS 9, use the `registerUserNotificationSettings` and `registerForRemoteNotifications` methods of `UIApplication`. Implement `UNUserNotificationCenter` with conditional code, as shown in this code sample.

#### Example: Registration
{% include gist.html sectionId="registration" names="Obj-C,Swift" gists="https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/9adf5dafa2ef98c9484aaa7a66d7668b.js,https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/5aabbd1337fab819109e427460e26ec7.js" %}

### Handle Push Notifications

To handle push notifications on iOS 9, implement `-application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler` with conditional code, as shown in this code sample.

#### Example: Handling
{% include gist.html sectionId="handling" names="Obj-C,Swift" gists="https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/5268061311a34b96a33c7cad97d237a3.js,https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/e0a96e7f956cc33c1d16f9e99e313500.js" %}
