iOS 9 is supported in the MarketingCloudSDK framework, under armv7, armv7s and arm64 architectures.

Supporting iOS 9 when building with Xcode 9 and later requires conditional coding via Apple's `available` attributes.

Specifically, conditional coding would be necessary in SDK configuration (registering for push notifications) and push notification handling.

### Push registration

Registering for push on iOS 9 requires using the `registerUserNotificationSettings` and `registerForRemoteNotifications` methods of `UIApplication`. Note the conditional handling of the usage of `UNUserNotificationCenter` here.

### Handle push notifications

You must implement `-application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler` with conditional code for iOS 9.
